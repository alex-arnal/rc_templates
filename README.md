# RC_TEMPLATES

This repository will contain a set of packages based on RComponent. The goal is being able to create new packages based on [RComponent](https://github.com/RobotnikAutomation/rcomponent) by executing a script that copies the template with the name of the package that we want to create and make all the necessary changes to make it compile.

## Usage

Being located in the desired template package, run:

```bash
./create_package.sh <new_package>
```
